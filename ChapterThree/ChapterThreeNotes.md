# For Loops

	for (var i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1)

- The first value is known as the initializer, traditionally the character i is used.
- For a multi-dimensional nested loop, the letter j is traditionally used.
- The second value is the comparison or condition value. This is the condition that has to be fulfilled to make the loop stop.
- The third value is the afterthought, which is what you want to do after each iteration of the array.
- Note that the semi-colon is used for the first two values, not the third value.
- All of the values are optional.  A Forever/Infinite loop can be created using this construct:

	    for (;;){}
